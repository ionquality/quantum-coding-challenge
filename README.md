## ðŸš€ Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository


git clone [https://github.com/your-username/quantum-epay.git](https://github.com/ionquality/quantum-coding-challenge.git)
cd quantum-coding-challenge
2. Install PHP Dependencies
Ensure you have Composer installed, then run:

composer install
3. Install Frontend Dependencies

npm install

4. Configure the Environment
   
Create a .env file in the project root:
Edit the following database environment variables in your .env:

DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=sail
DB_PASSWORD=password
These are the default credentials for the MySQL container used by Laravel Sail.

5. Start the Application Using Sail
Start the Docker containers using:

./vendor/bin/sail up
This will build and start the Laravel Sail containers for PHP, MySQL, Redis, and more.

6. Run Migrations and Seeders
Once the containers are running, initialize the database:

./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
This will drop all existing tables, recreate them, and populate the database with sample data.

Default Admin Credentials
After running the seeders, a default admin user will be available:

Email: admin@quantumepay.com

System Requirements
While Laravel Sail manages most dependencies through Docker, youâ€™ll still need the following installed on your system:

Docker (latest stable)

Docker Compose

Composer (latest stable)

Node.js & npm

Running Tests
To run feature or unit tests:

./vendor/bin/sail artisan test
Or, if PHPUnit is installed globally:
php artisan test

Useful Sail Commands

./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate          # Run migrations
./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed          # Seed the database
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev              # Compile frontend assets
./vendor/bin/sail tinker                   # Run Laravel REPL
